# Manual Download Commands

If the download scripts don't work, use these commands directly:

## Create Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p packages/tools
mkdir -p packages/wine
mkdir -p packages/winetricks-components
```

## Download Winetricks
```bash
cd packages/tools
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks
chmod +x winetricks
cd ../..
```

## Download Wine Stable for Fedora 42

### Option 1: Download Both Wine Packages
```bash
cd packages/wine

# Main Wine package
wget https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/fedora/42/x86_64/wine-stable-10.0-1.fc42.x86_64.rpm

# Wine common package
wget https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/fedora/42/x86_64/wine-common-10.0-1.fc42.noarch.rpm

cd ../..
```

### Option 2: Try Alternative Mirrors (if above fails)
```bash
# Try Fedora 41 if 42 not available
wget https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/fedora/41/x86_64/wine-stable-10.0-1.fc41.x86_64.rpm
wget https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/fedora/41/x86_64/wine-common-10.0-1.fc41.noarch.rpm

# Or try a different mirror
wget https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/fedora/x86_64/wine-stable-10.0-1.fc42.x86_64.rpm
```

## Verify Downloads
```bash
# Check what was downloaded
ls -lah packages/
ls -lah packages/tools/
ls -lah packages/wine/

# Total size
du -sh packages/
```

## Additional Reference Files
```bash
# Create RPM Fusion reference (copy/paste into a file)
cat > packages/tools/rpmfusion-setup.txt << 'EOF'
RPM Fusion Repositories for Fedora 42:

Free: https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-42.noarch.rpm
Non-free: https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-42.noarch.rpm
EOF
```

## What Gets Downloaded

| Component | Size | Required |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Winetricks | ~100 KB | ✅ Yes |
| wine-stable RPM | ~200-300 MB | ⏳ Optional |
| wine-common RPM | ~10-20 MB | ⏳ Optional |

**Total:** ~200-350 MB (if downloading RPMs)

## After Downloads

Once files are in `packages/` directory:

1. Transfer entire repository to your Fedora 42 machine
2. Run: `./sketchup-wine-setup/scripts/00-master-setup-offline.sh`
3. The script will find and use the downloaded packages automatically

## If Downloads Fail

The offline setup script has fallbacks:
- If Winetricks not found locally → uses system winetricks
- If Wine RPMs not found → uses dnf to download
- No packages needed → script still works, just downloads during setup

So even if downloads fail, you can still run the offline setup script on your machine and it will work!

---

**Bottom Line:** The `packages/` directory is optional. The offline setup script works either way. It's just faster if you pre-download the large components like WebView2 (~1-2 GB).
